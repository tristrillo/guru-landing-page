Landing page project for The Odin Project

This project is part of The Odin Project's curriculum where you are tasked to design and create a Landing Page. This project comes towards the end of the CSS portion of the foundation course, where you get to apply all you've learned so far, which includes flexbox.

For this project, I had my partner, who works in graphic design, send me over one of the products she designed, and assets that would be needed for it. I decided to clone her work in HTML and vanilla CSS.

I couldn't make a pixel perfect clone, and there are some subtle changes (working with a lot of images and background images was harder than I expected). Within this repository is an image that shows how the Landing Page is supposed to look like, and is the design I tried to clone. (Ignore all the red lines and borders, I added that there for visual aid when I was writing down the HTML.)
